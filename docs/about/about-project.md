The GRASA Events Locator is an events locator system to better connect Monroe County families to out-of-school programs in the Greater Rochester area.
This application was created for the [Greater Rochester After-School Alliance](https://www.racf.org/About/Giving-Circles-Initiatives-and-Partnerships/Greater-Rochester-After-School-Alliance) by Team Platypus at the [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/).


## High level project description

This takes the form of a web page containing a map that can be searched for programs.
The user can then be presented with further information and registration options.
This information was originally delivered via the [Explore Monroe website](http://exploremonroeny.com/calendar) as well as a physical book, the “[Adult Guide to Youth Services](https://www2.monroecounty.gov/files/youth/Adult_Guide%202011.pdf)”, both which GRASA and the Monroe County government wish to retire due to a lack of maintenance.
Representatives from the sponsor have presented Team Platypus with several examples, including [Newark Thrives](http://youthprogramlocator.newark-thrives.org/) and the [Dallas After-School Network](http://dasn.force.com/dapf/ProgramFinder) as examples of what the final deliverable should look and function similarly to.

The main highlight of the Resource Locator is the map.
Similar to the [Newark Thrives Youth Program Locator](http://youthprogramlocator.newark-thrives.org/), the end user will use a search box, filter categories, and interact with the map to locate programs.
These will be added to the site by the providers via an account system. An administrator from GRASA and the Monroe County government will approve these accounts, as well as creation and revisions of new programs.
GRASA and Monroe County administrators can also add resources to a fixed Resources page.
For the purposes of this project, the Resource Locator is not supported for programs beyond Monroe County.


## Objectives

The system accomplishes the following objectives for these user groups:

### Families

* Search for different programs and resources.
* Apply filters to better discover programs and resources that interest them.
* Find information to learn more about a specific program.

### Program providers

* Add new programs with specific session info (dates/time/location) into system for approval by administrators.
* Update information for existing programs in system for approval by administrators.

### GRASA and Monroe County staff

* Review and approve submitted programs.
* Confirm registration of new provider accounts.
