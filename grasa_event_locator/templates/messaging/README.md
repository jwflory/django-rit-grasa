Email messaging templates
=========================

These files generate email reply messages in the application.
Files include subject lines and mail body content.
**Note**: All subject lines _MUST_ not end with a newline character, or else the app will crash.

On Linux, to quickly remove the last character of a file (e.g. like a newline character), run this command:

```bash
truncate -s -1 <file_name>
```
