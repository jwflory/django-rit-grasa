The GRASA Event Locator is an event locator system to connect Monroe County families to out-of-school programs in the Greater Rochester area.
This application was created for the [Greater Rochester After-School Alliance](https://www.racf.org/About/Giving-Circles-Initiatives-and-Partnerships/Greater-Rochester-After-School-Alliance) and Monroe County, New York by [Team Platypus](#project-team) at the [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/).


## High level project description

This takes the form of a web page containing a map that can be searched for after-school events.
Users are presented with further information and registration options.
This information was originally delivered via the [Explore Monroe website](http://exploremonroeny.com/calendar) as well as a physical book, the “[Adult Guide to Youth Services](https://www2.monroecounty.gov/files/youth/Adult_Guide%202011.pdf)”, both which GRASA and the Monroe County government wish to retire due to lack of maintenance.
GRASA representatives presented Team Platypus with several examples, including [Newark Thrives](http://youthprogramlocator.newark-thrives.org/) and the [Dallas After-School Network](http://dasn.force.com/dapf/ProgramFinder) as examples of final deliverables.

The main highlight of the GRASA Event Locator is the map.
Similar to the [Newark Thrives Youth Program Locator](http://youthprogramlocator.newark-thrives.org/), the end user uses a search box with various filters and an interactive map to locate programs.
Evemts are added to the site by providers via an account system.
An administrator from GRASA and the Monroe County government approves these accounts, as well as creation and edits of an event.

For the purposes of this project, the Event Locator does not support programs and events beyond Monroe County.


## Objectives

The system accomplishes the following objectives for these user groups:

### Families

* Search for different programs and resources.
* Apply filters to better discover programs and resources that interest them.
* Find information to learn more about a specific program.

### Program providers

* Add new programs with specific session info (dates/time/location) into system for approval by administrators.
* Update information for existing programs in system for approval by administrators.

### GRASA and Monroe County staff

* Review and approve submitted programs.
* Confirm registration of new provider accounts.
